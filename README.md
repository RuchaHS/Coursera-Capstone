## Exploring venues in Mumbai, India using Foursquare and Zomato API

The rating is the most important feature of any restaurant as it is the first parameter that people look into while searching for a place to eat. It portrays the
quality, hygiene and the environment of the place. Higher ratings lead to higher profit margins. Notations of the ratings usually are stars or numbers scaling between 1 and 5. Zomato has changed the way people browse through restaurants. It has helped customers find good places with respect to their dining budget.
Different machine learning algorithms like SVM, Linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest can be used to predict the ratings of the restaurants.
